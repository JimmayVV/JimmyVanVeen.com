# ADR 11: Claude Code for AI-Assisted Development

## Status

Accepted and implemented

## Context

We needed to decide on development tooling and workflow approaches that would:

- Accelerate development velocity
- Maintain high code quality
- Provide architectural guidance
- Support complex refactoring tasks
- Enable rapid prototyping and iteration

## Decision

We chose to integrate Claude Code as a core part of our development architecture
and workflow.

## Rationale

### Pros

1. **Accelerated Development**: Significantly faster feature implementation
2. **Code Quality**: AI assistance in following best practices and patterns
3. **Architecture Guidance**: Help with complex architectural decisions
4. **Documentation**: Automated generation of comprehensive documentation
5. **Refactoring Support**: Confident large-scale code changes
6. **Learning Amplification**: Exposure to new patterns and approaches
7. **Context Awareness**: Understanding of entire codebase for suggestions

### Cons

1. **Tool Dependency**: Reliance on external AI service
2. **Cost Consideration**: Subscription cost for AI assistance
3. **Learning Curve**: Understanding how to effectively prompt and collaborate
4. **Quality Variance**: Output quality depends on prompt quality
5. **Review Necessity**: All AI-generated code requires human review

## Alternatives Considered

### GitHub Copilot

- **Pros**: IDE integration, wide adoption, autocomplete-style assistance
- **Cons**: Limited architectural context, less conversational, no file
  operations

### Traditional Development (No AI)

- **Pros**: Full human control, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Slower development, more manual documentation work

### Other AI Coding Tools

- **Pros**: Various specialized features
- **Cons**: Less comprehensive, limited file system integration

## Tradeoffs

### What We Gained

- 3-5x faster development velocity for complex features
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- Consistent architectural patterns
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Learning acceleration through AI pairing
- Confident refactoring of large codebases

### What We Sacrificed

- Some manual control over every line of code
- Additional tool dependency
- Monthly subscription cost
- Need for careful review of AI output

## Implementation Strategy

### Integration Points

1. **Architecture Planning**: Use for system design and ADR creation
2. **Feature Development**: Collaborative coding for new features
3. **Refactoring**: Large-scale code improvements and modernization
4. **Documentation**: Automated generation of technical documentation
5. **Code Review**: Additional perspective on code quality
6. **Debugging**: Assistance with complex debugging scenarios

### Workflow Integration

- Begin features with architectural discussion
- Implement with AI pair programming
- Review all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Use for documentation generation
- Leverage for complex refactoring tasks

### Quality Controls

1. **Human Review**: All AI code thoroughly reviewed
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of AI-assisted features
3. **Incremental Adoption**: Gradual integration into workflow
4. **Version Control**: Clear commit messages indicating AI assistance

## Success Metrics

- Development velocity increased significantly
- Documentation coverage improved dramatically
- Architectural consistency maintained
- Code quality metrics remained high
- Learning acceleration measurable

## Best Practices Developed

1. **Clear Context**: Provide comprehensive context in prompts
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Work with AI through multiple iterations
3. **Human Oversight**: Never merge without human review
4. **Documentation First**: Use AI to maintain up-to-date docs
5. **Pattern Consistency**: Leverage AI to maintain architectural patterns

## Dependencies

- ADR 01: TypeScript - Claude Code works better with typed codebases
- ADR 10: ESLint & Prettier - AI output follows established code quality rules

## Related ADRs

This decision enhances and accelerates all other architectural decisions by
providing AI assistance in implementation and maintenance.

## Future Considerations

- Monitor AI tool evolution and capabilities
- Evaluate other AI coding assistants as they mature
- Adjust workflow based on team experience
- Consider team training for AI-assisted development
