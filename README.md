Upon my learning Node.js (alongside companion frameworks Express.js, Mongoose and others) I decided to write my own personal website from scratch, using RESTFul methods to make a Blog, as well as Projects resources.

I am using this site as both a portfolio of my work, as well as a demonstration of the skills I've developed over time in regards to web development.

I am using this experience to try my hand with new frameworks such as Semantic UI, and CKEditor, as well as sharpening my skills with SASS, Node.js/Express/Mongoose, among others. This site will continue to grow as I incorporate other elements and API's into it, and the source code will be freely viewable on my Bitbucket account.
