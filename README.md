Web Development has been a never-ending process of continual improvement, and
constant learning.

Through this process, I have picked up several tools, and placed them in my
toolbelt. This repository serves as my home page, and my portfolio showing some
of my favorite projects I have worked on over the last several years.

All projects listed are included in my [Github](https://github.com/JimmayVV)
profile, and where applicable, are linked to their standalone URL's for
demonstration purposes.

Something to keep in mind is I have an entire repository where the projects I
have worked on as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
curriculum are stored. This means that one repository has many projects within
it. It's a mini site in and of itself. I have been debating whether or not to
extract the projects from it into their own repo's, but have held off for now.

This portfolio is built using React, GraphQL, and ES6 JavaScript, communicating
with version 4 of Github's API. If you have any questions, feel free to
[contact me](https://www.jimmyvanveen.com/#contact).
